# DINO_object_detection_model
DINO object detection model

Project Overview:
This project focuses on object detection using the DINO (DETR with Improved Noise injection) model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture for object detection. DINO builds upon the success of the DETR (Detection Transformer) model by improving object detection performance through the use of advanced noise injection techniques and better matching cost strategies. The model uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 (R50) backbone for feature extraction.

The main goals of this project are:

Evaluation: Use the pre-trained DINO model to evaluate its performance on the COCO validation dataset and report the bounding box Average Precision (AP) values for object detection. This will provide insights into how well the model detects objects in the validation set before any further training or fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the pre-trained DINO model on a custom training set to improve detection accuracy. This involves training the model on additional data, adjusting hyperparameters, and experimenting with various techniques to enhance performance.

Analysis: After fine-tuning, re-evaluate the model on the validation set and analyze the results. This includes visualizing detection results, identifying failure cases where the model misses or incorrectly predicts objects, and providing explanations for these errors.

The goal is to explore and improve the model's performance through fine-tuning, compare the results before and after, and provide a comprehensive analysis of its detection capabilities.
